# ToBreGa Reviews API

### System Design Capstone Overview
To build out API to support our FEC application. Our goal is to replace an existing API with a back end system that can support the full data set for the project and to scale to meet the demands of production traffic.

We will independently design a database and server that meets each of the requirements for various modules, and then deploy and scale the service to support at minimum 100 requests per second on AWS EC2 using a t2.micro instance.

### Objectives
 * Design and multiple database options to analyze and compare, selecting one database option
 * Transform the existing application data and load it into the database
 * Design and build an API server to provide data to the client in the format specified by the API documentation
 * Optimize your individual service by analyzing query times and server responses
 * Deploy your service and integrate it successfully with the FEC web application
 * Measure and improve the performance of your service at scale
 * Work as a team and scale your application's architecture to support loads up to tens of thousands of requests per second.
